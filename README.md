# Proton Analytics v4

MVP of Proton Analytics for my own cross-platform games. Fourth iteration of this product. Goal is bare-minimum; I am the only customer, and I can query data from SQL tools directly.

**Important note:** the client library requires OpenFL (which we use to persist the client ID). If you need this for other frameworks, or for things other than games, consider using a different approach, like using OpenFL to persist the client GUID.
